# Publishing and repositories

If the dataset you are shipping has a research application, the most relevant home for it would be Zenodo, which is a research data repository. Launched in 2013 in a joint collaboration between openAIRE and CERN, it provides a free, archival location for any researcher to depositor their datasets. The only limites to file sizes are 50gb for individual files, which is generous enough to accommodate a large number of use cases. Zenodo is able to accommodate larger file sizes upon request.

Another good alternative for Zenodo is figshare. Unlike Zenodo, figshare is a commmercially run data platform that provides a free tier for users.
