# Ten simple rules for publishing data

1. Publish the data with a DOI. Archive somewhere that is persistent and long-term and most likely a member of CLOCKSS.
2. Include a README file with a human readable description of the data
3. Provide a codebook or glossary for each variable
4. Provide a machine readable format for your data that describes what each column contains
