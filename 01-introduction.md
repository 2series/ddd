# Introduction

- Nearly all of modern scientific research is based on conclusions derived from data that are collected, analyzed, reported and visualized. 
- Major advances that form the foundation of nearly every field of endeavor would be impossible without such data.
- While the conclusions of studies are reported in the form of peer-reviewed publications, all of the associated artifacts that go into producing such papers are often never shared. Data are considered trade secrets and often shared only "upon request", in exchange of authorship, or only after an author has exhausted all publication opportunities, which often amounts to the data never being shared.
- Over the past decade, the movement broadly defined as open science has pushed for researchers to share as much (if not all) of their data, code, data management plans, and other protocols as they are considered to be scholarly outputs that are of more valuable to others than the final publication.
- For software, authors can collect all their code in software package, release them to package managers and also obtain publication credit (e.g. JOSS).
- With data it is often unclear on how authors might publish them, and also ensure appropriate credit and citation when used by others.
In this paper we want to explore how a research might release their data that comply both with the needs for long-term archiving but also serving the practical purposes 
- Importance of data sharing in research and data science
Data really needs to be managed like code and that's what this paper is all about.
- Various use cases for the data (teaching, training models, research applications)
