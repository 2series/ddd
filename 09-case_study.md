# Case Study

We have discussed different data documenting methods in section [@data-documenting]. We now briefly assess three case study applications, and assess data documenting strengths, and areas of improvement. These are assessed using the DARECO (DAta REusability COntinuum) described in section 2.

The three case study areas are:

1. A journal article from the journal "Data in Brief"
2. A dataset from five thirty eight, ""
3. A dataset from the government of Brisbane, Australia: ""
