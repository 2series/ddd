# Case Study

We have discussed different data documenting methods in section [@data-documenting]. We now briefly assess three case study applications, and assess data documenting strengths, and areas of improvement. These are assessed using the DARECO (DAta REusability COntinuum) described in section 2.

The three case study areas are:

1. A journal article from the journal "Data in Brief".
2. A dataset from five thirty eight, "What 12 Months Of Record-Setting Temperatures Looks Like Across The U.S.".
3. A dataset from the government of Brisbane, Australia: "Library Checkout Dataset".

# Data In Brief Article

## Five Thirty-Eight

We assess data from [five-thirty-eight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/), for the article ["What 12 Months Of Record-Setting Temperatures Looks Like Across The U.S."](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-12-months-of-record-setting-temperatures-looks-like-across-the-u-s/). The data source comes from [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history)

## Brisbane Governemnt.

We evaluate an example dataset from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Brisbane provides a [data portal](https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset). The data accessed was the [Library checkout dataset](https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/library-checkouts-branch-date#).
