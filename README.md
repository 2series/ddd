# Possible outline for the paper

- Introduction
- Challenges around sharing data (what is the current state of the system)
- How to share your data
    - By language
        - R
        - Python
        - Julia
        - Other package managers and languages
- How to document your data
- How to license your data
- How to publish data for maximum reuse
- Best, good, good enough, and worst practices around data
- Conclusions(?)/Ten simple rules for publishing your data

- Editorial on advice for publishing your data
    - Just spitballing some thoughts here. Why can't we `pip install a dataset` like we can for packages? What is the current state of the art for data managers (analogous to package managers)
    - 


## Misc sections
- A taxonomy of practices
- ``<-easy ------------------- time consuming-> (x)``
- ``<-fragile ---------------- robust-> (y)``
- Taxonomies have separate "user" and "developer" dimensions.
 
 
Other axis:
- size (5mb for CRAN, type thing. Small to big)
- complexity (images, tabular)
- persistence(?) 
- implementation (R, Python, Julia, etc)
- privacy (is the data identifiable?)
- usability
- purpose? (education only, data is the value)
