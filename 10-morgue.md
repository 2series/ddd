## Over-engineered (Fragile and Hard)

Designing something completely bespoke for a given task might not suit other cases, and can be very expensive to create. For example, a dataset could be painstakingly documented using a custom approach that fits that data and context. But in turn this makes it very difficult to read, interpret, and share. Such a dataset is characterized by being **fragile** and **time consuming**. An example of this would be a large, handwritten book that documents the process of designing an experiment. Hand written notes require scanning and encoding into images or PDF to share, and would require transcribing. This is time consuming. It is also fragile as the process can easily be lost. If the book dissappeared and there are no copies, the system would fail. Another example of fragile and time consuming is writing in bespoke software encoded in a binary format that cannot be read by other softwares. Or perhaps the data being recorded using a complex punch card system with thorough documentation. No one reads punch cards anymore, and sharing them is difficult. So it fails. This type of problem can result from trying to optimise and generalise too early. However it is still important
