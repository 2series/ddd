## Licensing

Data with a license clearly establishes rules on how everyone can modify, use, and share data. Without a license, these rules are unclear, and can lead to problems with attribution and citation. The world of licenses is big and complex, and trying to find the "right one" can be overwhelming. There are, however two licenses that are well suited for data sharing:

1. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY), and
2. Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0)

### CC BY

In short, CC BY 4.0 means that data can be shared and adapted, even for commercial use. However, you are required to provide appropriate credit to the source, link back to the CC BY license, and clearly show if changes were made. Data cannot be sublicensed, there is no warranty, and the person/people who obtained the data cannot be held liable. Appropriate credit means that you list the names of the creators, and link back to the original source. For a brief overview of the CC BY, see @ccby-short, and for the full license, see @ccby-long. The CC BY enforces attribution and due credit by default, but gives a lot of freedom for its use. The journal PLOS Comp Bio requires that data submitted cannot be more restrictive than CC BY [@plot-comp-bio-data].

### CC0

Contrasting the CC BY, is the CC0, a “public domain” license. The data owners waive all their rights to the work, and it now "owned" by the public. The data can be copied, modified, and distributed, even for commercial purposes _without asking permission_. This license does not enforce the attribution and due credit, but does mean that the data can be freely shared. When using data with CC0, it would be good practice to cite the original paper, but it is not needed . For a brief overview of the CC0, see @cc0-short, and for the full license, see

### Copyrighted data

Some data can be protected by copyright. For example ...

### Data embargo

Data under an embargo means that the data cannot be shared more widely until a specific release time. This means

### Adding a license to your data

To add a license to the data, a license file must be included in the same folder as the data. Here, the file can be shared as "LICENSE.MD" or simply "LICENSE". See an example in Supp Materials XX for various different license types. Before adding the license to the data, check the following:

- Do you have the right to the data
- Did you find / collect the data?

Additional information to include along with the license includes: ...
