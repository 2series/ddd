# Licensing

Data with a license clearly establishes rules on how everyone can modify, use, and share data. Without a license, these rules are unclear, and can lead to problems with attribution and citation. A recommended guideline from the creative commons to follow the acroynm ALM: **A**uthor, **L**icense, **M**achine-readability.

## Choosing a license

The world of licenses is big and complex, and it can be overwhelmeing to try and the right one for a use case. There are, however two licenses that are well suited for data sharing:

1. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY), and
2. Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0)

These are discussed briefly below.

### CC BY

Using a CC BY 4.0 for your data means that it can be shared and adapted, even for commercial use, but you must provide appropriate credit to the source, link back to the CC BY license, and clearly show if changes were made. Data under a CC BY 4 license cannot be sublicensed, that is - . There is also no warranty, so the person or people who obtained the data cannot be held liable. If data under a CC BY license is used, appropriate credit must be given - this means you list the names of the creators, and link back to the original source. The CC BY enforces attribution and due credit by default, but gives a lot of freedom for its use. The journal PLOS Comp Bio requires that data submitted cannot be more restrictive than CC BY [@plot-comp-bio-data]. For a brief overview of the CC BY, suitable to include in a README, see @ccby-short. For the full license, see @ccby-long.

### CC0

The CC0 is a “public domain” license. Data with a CC0 license means the data owners waive all their rights to the work, and it now "owned" by the public. The data can be copied, modified, and distributed, even for commercial purposes _without asking permission_. This license does not enforce the attribution and due credit, but does mean that the data can be freely shared. When using data with CC0, it is good practice to cite the original paper, but it is not needed. For a brief overview of the CC0, see @cc0-short, and for the full license, see @cc0-long.

### Copyrighted data

Data can be under copyright. For example ... This means that when sharing the data, you need to do this ..., and when citing the data, you need to do ...

### Data embargo

Data under an embargo means that the data cannot be shared more widely until a specific release time. If you are sharing data under an embargo, then detailed information on the embargo needs to be included. Additionally, a license should be included 

### Adding a license to your data

To add a license to the data, a license file must be included in the same folder as the data. The file can be shared as "LICENSE.MD" or simply "LICENSE". See an example in Supp Materials XX for various different license types. Before adding the license to the data, check the following:

- Do you have the right to the data
- Did you find / collect the data?

Additional information to include along with the license includes: ...
