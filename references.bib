However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.</jats:p>}, journal={eLife}, publisher={eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd}, author={McKiernan, Erin C and Bourne, Philip E and Brown, C Titus and Buck, Stuart and Kenall, Amye and Lin, Jennifer and McDougall, Damon and Nosek, Brian A and Ram, Karthik and Soderberg, Courtney K and et al.}, year={2016}, month={Jul} }

	abstract = {Despite the large body of research on missing value distributions and imputation, there is comparatively little literature on how to make it easy to handle, explore, and impute missing values in data. This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with a goal to integrating missing value handling as an integral part of data analysis workflows. New data structures are defined along with new functions (verbs) to perform common operations. Together these provide a cohesive framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods have been made available in the R package `naniar`.},
