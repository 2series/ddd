# How to document your dataset

Documenting a dataset is ensures others understand why the data was collected, how it was used, and how to use it appropriately. A .csv file alone in a folder with no other information is unhelpful. By the same token, providing too much information can make it difficult to understand, and where to start. There is a **da**ta **re**usability **co**ntinuum (DARECO). At one end there is a plain text or perhaps proprietary format file alone in a folder, towards the middle there is an accompanying human readable README file that describes the data and a machine readable format for reading in the data, and at the far end is the complete information to completely reproduce the data, intructions, motivation, manual, and so on.

_figure of the continuum from only data, to data + readme + machine readable code + full instruction set_

Researchers and analysts should aim to be at the "good enough" as the new minimum: A README with human context, machine readable statement of variables, and the raw data. Some examples of data documentation are now discussed, and ranked on the CARECO.

## EML

The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is stated as ([on their website](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/index.html))
The EML project is an open source, community oriented project dedicated to providing a high-quality metadata specification for describing data relevant to the ecological discipline. EML provides a very highly structured approach to documenting data. This is at one end of the "Data reproducibility spectrum"
There is an R interface to this: https://github.com/ropensci/EML

## Journal "Data papers"

Journals are now adding "data papers", specifically designed for publishing and sharing data. These provide more information and context around, crucial to understanding the data structure.

For example, **Elsevier's Data In Brief** aims to provide an outlet where researchers can easily share and reuse data by publishing articles about the data. The aim is to thoroughly describe the data, facilit

quote:
    > - Thoroughly describe your data, facilitating reproducibility.
    > - Make your data, which is often buried in supplementary material, easier to find.
    > - Increase traffic towards associated research articles and data, leading to more citations.
    > - Open up doors for new collaborations.
    > - Because you never know what data will be useful to someone else, Data in Brief welcomes submissions that describe data from all research areas."

**Here are the sections of a "Data In Brief" article:**

- Title, authors and author affiliations
- Abstract
- A completed Specifications Table
- 3-5 bullet points that explain why the data is valuable to other researchers
- A direct link to the deposited data (when applicable)
- A complete description of the experimental design and materials and methods
- References

Of particular interest are the sections **Completed specifications table** and **complete description of the experimental design and materials and methods**

The Completed specifications table is listed in bullet form here:

- Subject area
        - E.g., physics, chemistry, biology, economics, psychology
- More specific subject area
        - Describe narrower subject area.
- Type of data
                - Table, image (x-ray, microscopy, etc.), text file, graph, figure
- How data was acquired
                - Microscope, survey, SEM, NMR, mass spectrometry, etc.; if an instrument was used, please give the model and make.
- Data format
                - Raw, filtered, analyzed, etc.
- Experimental factors
                - Brief description of any pretreatment of samples
- Experimental features
                - Very brief experimental description
- Data source location
                - City, country, and/or latitude and longitude (and GPS coordinates) for collected samples/data, if applicable
- Data accessibility
                - State if data is with this article or in public repository; if public repository, please explicitly name repository and data identification number, and provide a direct URL to data.
- Related research article
                - If your data article is submitted as a companion paper to a research article, please cite your associated research article here; you may reference this as "in press."
                - If this is a direct submission to Data in Brief, you may cite the most relevant research article here.

Whilst this table provides a good standard, it does not provide the same resolution of information as a Data Dictionary.

**Complete description of the experimental design and materials and methods**.

> Offer a complete description of the experimental design and methods used to acquire the data and, where applicable, to perform the analysis. Include any relevant figures and tables needed to understand the data fully. Please also provide, where applicable, any code files used for base-level analysis or filtering of the data

- This is a good standard, but I canâ€™t help but think that this could be more explicitly expanded.

# Documenting using code books

There are also other formats, such as data dictionaries or code books, which are recommended for use when sharing data @Ellis2017. These "codebooks" are provided in STATA, which provides a "codebook" command. This allows you to describe the data, using a set of commands.
